A mobile application and associated unit tests that can price a basket of
goods in a number of different currencies.

• The goods that can be purchased, which are all priced in US$, are:
• Peas: $ 0,95 per bag
• Eggs: $ 2,10 per dozen
• Milk: $ 1,30 per bottle
• Beans: $ 0,73 per can

• The program allows the user to add or remove items in a basket. The user
can click on a checkout button, which will then display the total price for the
basket with the option to display the amount in different currencies. For
example, if the basket contained milk and the currency selected was EUR with
an exchange rate of 1.1, the total wouldbe 1.43 EUR.

• The list of currencies is consumed from http://jsonrates.com/.
